# Secret Word Game
## A simple React game project to evolve my skills

This application was hosted at (https://theprogmatheus.github.io/secret-word-game/)

This project is part of a course I'm studying, follow the prints:

### Stage 1, Menu

### Stage 2, Game

### Stage 3, End

With this project I learned to use two more very important hooks {useEffect, useCallBack}.

It also helped to understand how to use the useState hook correctly.

It was a good project, I still think it's kind of "simple", but it's much more complex than a calculator, isn't it?

anyway... see you in a next project, by.
